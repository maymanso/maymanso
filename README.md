## Hello, I'm Mayara Manso  ‚úåüèº


I am a frontend developer with a background in FullStack Development from Ironhack and a Front-End Bootcamp from {reprograma}. I have been working since 2019, with experience at Uber, Cornershop and MercadoLivre, where I developed web applications such as Uber Eats, Ubercado, MercadoEnvios and Backoffice.

 #### üíª    I have skills in: 
- TypeScript,
- JavaScript,
-  Node.js,
-  MongoDB,
-  CSS, HTML, Sass,
-   Styled Components,
-  Jest,
-    React, and Hooks. 
-    React Testing Library,
-    Apollo GraphQL

Passionate about creating intuitive and attractive web interfaces, I am looking for challenges that allow me to continuously learn. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis. Let's connect and discuss how we can collaborate!
